# three-devtools

**three-devtools** is a web extension that allows inspection of three.js content.

> ## ðŸš¨ Status: Experimental
> **three-devtools** is very much in an alpha/experimentation stage. Use at your own risk. Follow the [Baseline Milestone](https://github.com/jsantell/three-devtools/milestone/1) for issues and considerations that need to be solved in order for some stability.

## Current API

This API has not been thought out at all, but this will register your
THREE.Scene and THREE.Renderer to be observed by the tools.

```js
if (window.ThreeDevTools) {
  window.ThreeDevTools.addScene(scene);
  window.ThreeDevTools.addRenderer(renderer);
}
```

## Development

Architecture & development notes can be found in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
